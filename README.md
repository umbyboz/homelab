# Homelab

This repository documents my personal homelab, used to learn and practice **Linux, networking, and cybersecurity** from the ground up.  
The lab evolves as my skills grow and serves as a practical environment for experimentation, self-hosting, and penetration-testing practice.

---

## Purpose

- Build hands-on experience with Linux and core infrastructure  
- Explore networking concepts in a controlled environment  
- Host vulnerable applications for security testing  
- Support my learning path toward penetration testing and CTF platforms  
- Document configurations, notes, and experiments along the way

## Notes

- All configurations are sanitized and contain no real secrets.
- This homelab is strictly for educational and legal use only.
